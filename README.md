# Hypergrid V2

The second generation of the Hypergrid Framework.

# What's New?

The Sonic SVM protocol represents a groundbreaking advancement in tokenomics by establishing the world’s first functioning attention capital market. By tokenizing and creating a liquid market for human attention—arguably the most valuable resource in the information age we’ve designed a system that fundamentally redefines on-chain value exchange. Our HSSN-powered infrastructure systematically captures, quantifies, and redistributes attention as a programmable asset through: an innovative Attention Capital Funnel that transforms off-chain awareness into on-chain value; a PageRank-inspired Authority Score system fostering ecosystem-wide synergy; precise Programmatic Attention Metrics tracked over defined epochs; and a sophisticated Incentive Mechanism driving a perpetual Attention Flywheel. This represents more than technological infrastructure it launches a new economic paradigm where attention becomes a first-class asset class, empowering developers and users alike in a truly meritocratic digital economy.
